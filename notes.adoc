= Notes on C

== Variables and Types

There's a level of style when it comes to the placement of `*`, in declarations. However, for the
sake of simplicity, just use `char *name1, *name2` for consistency's sake.

In a declaration, an asterisk declares a pointer, and then later when you're using that declared
variable, you'd use `*name` to dereference the pointer and attain the actual value.

`char`::
    A single character. C doesn't actually have a `string` type.
    Instead, to create a string, you would use `char *name`; a `char *name` creates a series of
    characters in memory.
    * When using with with something like `fprintf()`, you actually just pass the non-dereferenced
      variable; `fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", usage)` will work fine, as `fprintf()` expects a `char*`.

=== Pitfalls

`const`::
    `const` is basically just syntactic sugar. It'll make the compiler emit warnings but it doesn't
    really mean anything, semantically.
